## MySideEffect


**Problem:**
There is a lot of medical research going on, but usually there is no real information about it other than on the prescription. Additionally, not all side effects are distributed equally, or you are even allergic to some ingredients.

**Solution:**
* Analyzing medical science papers about adverse side effects, save them and keep the information updated
* Provide a interface for searching the name of a drug, and showing old and new information about it
* Based on a Symptom, showing relevant drugs and the severity and frequency of their side effects
* If you create a user-profile, drugs irrelevant for you (based on allergies, location (availability), preferences, ...) will not be shown
* The more information there is about a patient, the more specific and helpful are the suggestions going to be


**Data resources:**
* PubMed (MEDLINE) - API for bulk download: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/
* (others?)
